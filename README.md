# Tetris 

This is a Tetris game implemented using plain JavaScript (JS), DOM, and HTML. The goal of the game is to stack falling blocks to create complete horizontal lines, which will then be cleared, earning points. The game must meet the following requirements:

## Features

- Smooth Performance: The game should run at a consistent 60 frames per second (FPS) without any frame drops.
- RequestAnimationFrame: Proper use of RequestAnimationFrame API for optimal animation rendering.
- Pause Menu: Implement a pause menu with options to continue and restart the game.

## Controls

- Keyboard: The game should be playable using keyboard controls only. Ensure the controls are smooth, meaning that holding down a key should trigger continuous action without interruptions.

## Performance Monitoring

It is crucial to measure the performance of your game to ensure smooth animation and optimal gameplay. You can use the following developer tools available in most web browsers:

- Page Inspector: View and edit page content and layout.
- Web Console: See console logs and interact with the game using JavaScript.
- Performance Tool: Analyze the game's responsiveness, JavaScript performance, and layout performance. Check for frame drops, function execution times, and other useful metrics.
- Paint Flashing: Enable the option to highlight every paint that occurs on the page as actions are performed.

## How to Play

- Start the game and control the falling blocks using the keyboard controls.
- Aim to create complete horizontal lines by filling them with blocks.
- Cleared lines will earn you points and make space for new blocks.
- The game ends when the blocks reach the top of the screen.

Enjoy playing Tetris!
